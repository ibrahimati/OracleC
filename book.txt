This is a paragraph about a pargraph. There once was a paragraph in a book. It had it's own characteristics and was unique in its own right.
However, it was a short linking paragraph and wanted to be more eventful like its brothers. 
It laid around and pouted for a while until one day it disappeared. Readers woud open the book and would fail
to understand was going on. The ending was ruined for them and they pouted angrily about a lack of suspense and
a lapse in information. The pargraph watched from afar and realized its worth as did its brothers. So paragraph 
returned to the delight of all other paragraphs and readers and fromthen it happily linked and stayed in the 
middle while readers enjoyed it and fellow paragraphs cheered it on.
